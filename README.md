# Predicting Battery Degredation Using Machine Learning 			

•	Developed a machine learning algorithm capable of accurately predicting capacity loss of lithium-ion batteries using Python and MATLAB

•	Reviewed model performance analytics and refined the learning algorithm to achieve 30% higher efficiency in data-processing and model accuracy

•	Conducted a literature review of previous experimental attempts which tried to accurately predict the process parameters of lithium-ion batteries
